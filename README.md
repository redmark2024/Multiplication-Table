![OIP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55ceb34a-006d-4e61-a444-6add2ec080f7)



This tool is designed to help with coding practice for understanding and using the while loop in Python. It provides an interactive way to learn how to create and control a loop that repeats until a certain condition is met.



The key concepts covered by this tool include:

User Input: Taking user input to define a variable (n) to calculate the multiplication table.
While Loop: Understanding how a while loop functions and how to control its execution using a condition (i <= 10).
Incrementing a Variable: Using the i = i + 1 statement to update the loop variable for each iteration.
Print Statement: Using print() to display output to the user.
