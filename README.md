# Multiplication-Table
This tool is designed to help with coding practice for understanding and using the while loop in Python. It provides an interactive way to learn how to create and control a loop that repeats until a certain condition is met.



The key concepts covered by this tool include:

User Input: Taking user input to define a variable (n) to calculate the multiplication table.
While Loop: Understanding how a while loop functions and how to control its execution using a condition (i <= 10).
Incrementing a Variable: Using the i = i + 1 statement to update the loop variable for each iteration.
Print Statement: Using print() to display output to the user.
